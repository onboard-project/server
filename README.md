# üåê Onboard Server

>[!Note]
> **EDUCATIONAL PROJECT DISCLAIMER**
>
>This project is developed purely for **educational and demonstrative purposes**. While it aims to provide useful public transport information for Milan, it relies on data sources, including scraping information from `giromilano.atm.it`.
>
>**The terms of service for ATM (Azienda Trasporti Milanesi) regarding data usage are not explicitly clear, and this project may potentially violate them.**
>
>Therefore:
>- **Use at Your Own Risk:** We do not guarantee the accuracy or continued availability of the data, nor do we assume responsibility for any consequences arising from its use.
>- **Unscheduled Discontinuation:** This project, or parts of it, may be taken down or become non-functional unexpectedly if ATM's policies change or if the data sources become inaccessible.

>We advise caution and understanding of these limitations.

The heart of the [Onboard Project](https://github.com/onboard-project), this Vercel Python backend is responsible for fetching, processing, and serving real-time public transport data for Milan. It acts as the central data hub for the entire Onboard ecosystem, providing structured information to the client application.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Real-time Data Scraper:** Scrapes live transport data from `giromilano.atm.it` to provide accurate arrival and waiting times.
*   **Open Data Integration:** Combines scraped data with official open data sources for comprehensive stop and line information.
*   **Vercel Deployment:** Optimized for serverless deployment on Vercel, ensuring high availability and scalability.
*   **RESTful API:** Exposes a clean and well-documented RESTful API for the [Onboard SDK](https://github.com/onboard-project/sdk) and [Client](https://github.com/onboard-project/client) to consume.
*   **Data Caching:** Implements intelligent caching mechanisms to reduce load on source systems and improve response times.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The server orchestrates data flow by:

1.  Periodically fetching the latest stop data, often generated by [`onboard-project/stopsgen`](https://github.com/onboard-project/stopsgen).
2.  Scraping real-time vehicle arrival information from official transport websites.
3.  Processing and transforming this raw data into a structured format.
4.  Serving this enriched data via various API endpoints (e.g., stops, lines, real-time predictions).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### API Documentation

The deployed API is accessible at: `https://onboard-project-api.vercel.app`

Explore the available endpoints and their responses (e.g., `/stops`, `/lines`) to understand the data structure.

### Local Development

To set up the server for local development:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/onboard-project/server.git
    cd server
    ```
2.  **Create Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the Server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The server will typically run on `http://localhost:8000`.
